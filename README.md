The project aims to develop a database management system for the ESPN cricket dataset, which will store and retrieve cricket statistics efficiently. The system will provide users with a consolidated and standardized source of information, enabling quick querying and filtering of data. It will enhance the reliability, usability, and accessibility of the dataset, with a focus on creating an intuitive user interface. The database system offers scalability, flexibility, and strong security features to prevent unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction of the dataset. Overall, the project aims to simplify data reporting and analysis, making it simpler to draw insights from the information.

I.	PROBLEM STATEMENT
The database system for the ESPN cricket dataset will solve the problem of efficiently storing, managing, and retrieving the vast amount of data associated with cricket matches, players, batting stats, bowling stats and teams. The project aims to develop a database management system that can efficiently store and retrieve cricket statistics. By organizing the data into a database, users will be able to quickly query the data and filter it to extract relevant information, such as player statistics, player scores, and player details. For cricket fans, commentators, and scholars, this will provide a consolidated and standardized source of information. It helps to access and analyze this data to make informed decisions about team selection, game strategies, player performance, and broadcasting content. The goal of the project is to provide cricket enthusiasts with a comprehensive and user-friendly platform to explore and analyze player statistics. 
The database systems help to know about top performing players in a specific format (Test, ODI, T20I, First-class), players with the highest batting averages or most wickets in a particular match, comparison of a player's performance across different formats, team performance in different formats. 

The project also focuses on creating an intuitive user interface that enables users to easily access and visualize the data. The database system will enhance the ESPN cricket dataset in reliability, usability, and accessibility, while supporting a variety of cricket-related activities and use cases. The database system will also make it possible to integrate and share data effectively across various platforms and applications, which might help in the creation of new cricket-related products and services. 

A database system will help to avoid the limitations of spreadsheets and ensure that the data is well- organized and consistent across different tables. With SQL queries, a database system will make it possible to efficiently retrieve certain data items or subsets of data. This will simplify data reporting and analysis, making it simpler to draw insights from the information. A database system offers scalability and flexibility in terms of data storage, performance, and application integration. Strong data security features like user authentication, data encryption, and access control may be offered by database systems. This will assist in preventing illegal access, alteration, or destruction of the dataset. An excel file is not optimized for large datasets. It lacks the features like indexing, normalization, and constraints.
